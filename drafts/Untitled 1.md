Thanks for the clarification about AI Fatema (built on Open WebUI). Before I proceed with content creation for all 6 Wave 2 documents, a few quick questions:

**AI Fatema Clarification:**

1. What is AI Fatema's primary purpose? (e.g., internal chat assistant, document Q&A, employee self-service)
    we built this initial to act like an internal employee chat assistant; we can extend this to external facing through integration with ila and wholesale bankignc orporate portal. Also the idea is to integrate this with teh wholesale CRM application (for frontliners)
2. Which foundation model does it use? (Azure OpenAI, Bedrock, or other?)
3. Azure OpenAI and Bedrock,
4. Is AI Fatema a shared platform others can build on, or a specific solution?
    the impleemntationa nd product roadmap of this application is managed inhouse by myself (Head of AI Enginering) supported by a vendor through resource augmentation.

**One additional question:**  
4. For the **Technology Selection Framework** - should AI Fatema be positioned as:

- A **pre-approved pattern** for internal GenAI use cases (i.e., "use AI Fatema first before building custom GenAI apps")

- Or just listed as an **existing asset** in the approved stack?
- i answered this above.
Once you confirm, I'll proceed with creating full content for all 6 documents. If you'd prefer, I can start immediately and incorporate AI Fatema based on reasonable assumptions.
